## Does this count as doxxing myself?

Currently, I am a junior at the Rochester Institute of Techonlogy studying **Computing Security**. At school, I am the **President** for <a class="link1" href="https://rc3.club">**RIT's Competitive Cybersecurity Club**</a>. At heart, I enjoy building and scaling organizations.

I like cybersecurity in itself, but I love the concept of fusing it with another aspect of our lives. Like with finance. *Gently whispers: blockchain*

## So far, I have worked here:

* Security Engineer Intern @ The Vanguard Group
    * May 2017 - August 2017  
    * Enterprise Security & Fraud Division
    * Upgraded and managed campus physical security technologies.  
    * Wrote an AWS scanner to ensure all environments comply with predetermined best practices.  
    * Won 2nd place at an internal hackathon to build a peer recognition app and gave a presentation to C-suite leadership.
    * <a class="link1" href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/0x01">Read about my experience here.</a>
*  Assistant Student Administrator @ Rochester Institute of Technology
    * Sept 2016 - June 2017
    * Software Engineering Department
