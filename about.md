## Does this count as doxxing myself?

Currently, I am a senior at the Rochester Institute of Techonlogy studying **Computing Security**. I used to run the <a class="link1" href="https://rc3.club">**RIT's Competitive Cybersecurity Club**</a>, but I'm spending my last year working on personal projects. At heart, I enjoy building organizations and leading teams.

I like cybersecurity in itself, but I love the concept of fusing it with another aspect of our lives. Like with finance. *Gently whispers: blockchain*

*  Security Engineer Intern @ CoreOS, Red Hat
