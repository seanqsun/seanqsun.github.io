**Description**  
This project was created initially by a personal need when I started making this blog. I have this problem where I don't like typing in front of other people, so instead of learning to man up and just realize it's okay if someone else reads your most embarassing thoughts, I decided I should figure out a way to write privately, in public.

The technologies and skills used in the creation of this project were:  
Flask, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS

**The Problem**  
I hate writing in public. I really hate it. And people are nosy.
But I go to school and am in public for a large part of my day. And the nosiest people are students. So how do I write posts in the middle of class without being judged by my peers line by line?

**The Solution**  
I could have bought a privacy filter and called it a day. Or I could have just worked in more private areas. But I guess that isn't as cool as the idea of writing in obfuscation. After some brainstorming, I realized that as long as keystrokes were being logged, the output of the text didn't matter to me as long as I could see the correct text later.  

So to do that, all you really need is to just open up Word and start typing in WingDings. But where's the fun in that?

Inspired by lightweight notepads in the cloud like <a class="link1" href="http://notepad.pw">notepad.pw</a> I wanted make these notes accessible anywhere Internet enabled. And so, cryptogra.me was born. 

**The Product**  
The requirements I gave myself were as such:  
* Webapp  
* Decode at will  
* Accessible later on  
* Mobile compliant  
* Not ugly 

**This project is still in the works**
